# Begineer-s-Hypothesis-DSG
This file is in accordance to the contest conducted by DSG IIT Roorkee against estimating the depth of ice on a particular day.
Firstly I deployed three different modes of regression, i.e. Linear, Polynomial, Support Vector Machine, and created three different models. Then I trained the model using data provided. Lastly I calculated the R2 score of each model and selected the model with highest score (which in my case is Polynomial Regression model) to predict the test values and wrote the values in a csv file named "Predicted_Snow_Depth.csv".
Values written in csv file are in format given in file named "sample_submission.csv".
